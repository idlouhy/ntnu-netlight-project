\begin{abstract}

Imagine the old minimachine systems where the end user works in a domain specific application in a black-and-green terminal. She is super efficient, jumping between windows with short cuts and everything is "in her fingers".
 
This is then replaced with a web-frontend and a mouse. Everything is "wrong", the design makes the usage patterns locked and she gets "mouse sickness" from point-clicking every command.
 
The task is to modify a web-application and add a scripting-console where the end-user can enter commands into a DSL - similar to the older interface. When commands are run, the results are shown both in the console and the web-interface. The use can still use the mouse and navigate as usual.
 
The target is a simple proof-of-concept in order to research any changes to the API, the potential of the method as well as evaluate the usability of scripting languages/DSL and API.
