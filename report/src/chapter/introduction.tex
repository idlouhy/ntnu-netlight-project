\section{General information about project}
The project is the making of the course TDT4290 Customer Driven Project. This is a mandatory subject for all 4th year students at IDI and aims to give all its students experience in a customer guided IT-project and the feel of managing a project in a group. The customer assign the group a task which makes the project close to normal working life situation.

This is a proof of concept project. The underlying task is to research and develop a system where power users can benefit from a console.  The concept aims to ease the workload of a power user who is working with object editing, and to see how the efficiency of a console might prove to improve the work. The power user is usually a user who often works with the system over a longer time, and is in depth familiar with the system. We will research already existing systems of this kind, and look at the possibilities and advantages of such a system in a chosen domain.

\section{Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Create a working prototype of a system where a scripting console is embedded into a modern web interface. The console should provide access to viewing and modifying the underlying data objects of the system's domain via a DSL.
  \item Investigate the ramifications of the added functionality, in terms of usability and technical aspects.
  \item Provide extensive documentation and a successful presentation of the end product.
\end{enumerate}
