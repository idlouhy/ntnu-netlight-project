\chapter{Sprint 3}
This chapter will outline the work we did in the third sprint. It explains in detail how we planned the sprint, including which user stories we chose and the architecture we employed to implement these. Details on the implementation on each user story is also included, as well documentation on the testing process. Finally our evaluation of the first sprint is presented. This chapter contains the following sections about the sprint:
\begin{itemize}
\item Plan
\item Architecture
\item Implementation
\item Testing
\item Customer feedback
\item Evaluation
\end{itemize}


\section{Planning}

\subsection{Duration}
This sprint started on October 22th and will last for two weeks. A customer demo will be held at 1st of November to show of what we have achieved during the sprint and to ensure that the customer agrees with the solutions and the direction we are going in.

\subsection{Sprint Goal}
The goal for this sprint is to redesign the system to accomodate the new wishes from the customer, and present a working protoype with the suggested technologies.

At the end of sprint 2 the customer representative informed us that he would have a meeting with others in the company, to try to identify what our product was missing, a x- factor that would appeal to the users and promote the console.

At the Scrum meeting for the third sprint he announced that they had indeed found this x- factor. He wanted us to return to the roots of the project, namely adding scripting to a web- page. We should focus on adding functionality which is impossible or difficult and time consuming to do in a regular GUI.

He wanted us to add functionality that would show of the advantages of the technologies we are using, and how it would not be possible to do this with more traditional technologies. He listed some general use cases he wanted us to implement, and suggested that we looked into another solution for the backend. This was because he felt that this solution was better suited for the use cases he now presented us. He was aware of the time constraints of the project and did not expect us to manage to implement all the functionality he mentioned. But it was important that we could document that it would be possible to implement it with the technologies we are using in this project.
