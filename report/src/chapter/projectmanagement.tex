\section{Architecture}
The system is to be described in this chapter. This includes the main parts of the system, the architectural drivers, how they are connected together, and their collaboration. 

The architecture will be described through the 4+1 view model. The party members, or the stakeholders of the system, will have different concerns, so the 4+1 view model will help us describe the system for each of them, and make sure that all expectations are accounted for.
