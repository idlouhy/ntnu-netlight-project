\chapter{Sprint 2}
\section{Planning}

\subsection{Duration}
This sprint started on October 8th and will last for two weeks. A customer demo will be held at October 18th to show of what we have achieved during the sprint and to ensure that the customer agrees with the solutions  and the direction we are going in.

\subsection{Sprint Goal}
The goal of the second sprint is to increase the functionality of the console. We will try to include user stories that add functionality that is easy to use and is valuable for the end user. The user stories concerned with domain specifics of the system, like implemeting support for adding users to the library, will be left untouched in this sprint.

\subsection{User Stories}
As of this sprint we tried to split each user story into smaller sub- tasks that could be distributed easily amonst the group members. Each estimate for the subtasks includes design and implementation of the solution. Testing includes writing unit tests as we code, write test cases and to perform them. Documentation includes all the work necessary to document our work on that user story in the report.

For this sprint we had 110 hours available for the sprint, exluding work on the report, project management, sprint planning and evaluation. Its a bit less than normal as we decided to put in some extra work on the pre- delivery of the report on October 14th.

\subsection{Test Evaluation}
Some of our test failed this time. Most of them was due to minor bugs in the system which was easily corrected at once. The remaining failures was due to some missing functionality which was defined by the user stories and where yet to be implemented at the time the testing was performed. However we were able to add this functionality before the beginning of the third sprint.
