\chapter{Sprint 4}

\minitoc

This chapter will outline the work we did in the fourth and final sprint. It explains in detail how we planned the sprint, including which user stories we chose and the architecture we employed to implement these. Details on the implementation on each user story is also included, as well documentation on the testing process. Finally our evaluation of the last sprint is presented.

\section{Planning}

\subsection{Duration}
This sprint started on November 5th and lasted for two weeks. A final customer demo was held on the 17th of November to show of the final product for the customer.

\subsection{Sprint Goal}
For this sprint a lot of our focus was put on the report and preparation of the final report. At the beginning at the sprint both the team and the customer agreed that the the product was good and only needed minor improvements for the final presentation. So the goal for this sprint was to get as much work done on the report as possible and at the same time start to prepare much of the final presentation. Also we would like to implement small improvements to the system, making it ready for the final presentation.


\subsection{Product Backlog}
For Sprint 4, the customer primarily wanted us to focus on making the prototype more fit for demonstration purposes, and work on documentation, including the report, a user manual and a deployment manual. 

The user stories completed in sprint 3 were removed, and the following user stories were added:

\begin{itemize}
\item G20 - As a user, I want to be able to add new objects to the system using a simple syntax.
\item G21 - As a user, I want to be able to delete objects from the system using a simple syntax.
\item G22 - As a user, I want to be able to define and execute scripts.
\end{itemize}

The full product backlog for sprint 4 can be found in section \ref{sprint4pb} in the appendix.

\subsection{Sprint Backlog}
The user stories included in the sprint backlog is presented in Table~\ref{table:sp4backlog}. Because the majority of the desired functionality was already implemented, we would spend less time on implementation on this sprint.
