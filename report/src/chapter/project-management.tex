\section{Project name}
Project name is important project identificator. It should summarize main project goal or functionality. In real project, is often a trademark, or reflects the name of the company.

In this section, we will describe the process of choosing a name for the project. First of all, we made a list of words, that we can use in the project name. These words describe project funcionality or goal.

Words that can be used in project name: master, console, web, text, keyboard

We used the list of words and brainstorming session on a meeting for compiling a list of project name candidates:

Candidate project names: console 2.0, wonsole, wensole, websole, werminal, interCLI

After discussion we chose the name \emph{Wonsole}. Project name can be sometimes little confusing, so we added the subtitle: \emph{The new web console for power users.}

school information system (boring)
time management system (aka calendar)
facebook console (unreal)
mail interface (gmail is too good, not useful)
photo gallery (limited)
music library (limited)
physician system (treatments, prescriptions, add person)
tax form (boring)
Building management (boring)

Criteria:
Interesting and simple enough for test subjects to understand. something they meet in everyday life
Complicated enough to demonstrate the problem.
Console has to be useful in the domain, ease the workflow
Object oriented design
Existence of power user, that will use the console

Customer ideas:
car models
finn.no
health sector
human resources (people, how they are related, symptoms, how much money and what they own - advanced domain graph). 
contact lists (peder)


write these things to the report


Future:
batch operations
undo the commands
save command for object attribute editing
what about object operations?
transaction support
