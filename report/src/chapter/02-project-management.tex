\section{Project name}
Project name is important project identificator. It should summarize main project goal or functionality. In real project, is often a trademark, or reflects the name of the company.

In this section, we will describe the process of choosing a name for the project. First of all, we made a list of words, that we can use in the project name. These words describe project funcionality or goal.

Words that can be used in project name: master, console, web, text, keyboard

We used the list of words and brainstorming session on a meeting for compiling a list of project name candidates:

Candidate project names: console 2.0, wonsole, wensole, websole, werminal, interCLI

After discussion we chose the name \emph{Wonsole}. Project name can be sometimes little confusing, so we added the subtitle: \emph{The new web console for power users.}

\section{Meetings}
\subsection{Advisor meeting}
Advisor meetings will occur every Thursday 09:15, unless anything else is specified, so the advisor gets updated on the latest work and progress of the project. The day before the meeting the group sends the advisor an agenda for the meeting and a status report of what is done since the last meeting, this lets the advisor enter the meeting prepared, and improve the efficiency of the meeting. Under the meeting issues regarding the work done, plans for next week and project management will be discussed. If there is a sprint-end-week the demo for this sprint will also be shown. Advisor notes will be written during the meetings, compiled and sent back to the advisor.

\subsection{Customer meeting}
Customer meetings will occurs on demand, but usually weekly, and Thursdays 19:15 if there is a sprint-end-week, unless anything else is specified. There will be sent an agenda for the meeting and the customer will be sent the weekly report to be kept in the loop of the progress, and get prepared before the meetings. Since the customer is busy during work hours, the meetings are kept after 18:00 on weekdays, and after 12:00 in weekends. They will be kept over skype, since the customer is located in Oslo. The meetings will be used to get the customer in the loop, clarify uncertainties and redirecting, if the direction of the project taken is not what the customer had in mind. The customer should also be included in the sprint planning meetings to help with use case prioritization. Customer notes will be written during the meetings, compiled and sent back to the customer.
\subsection{Internal meeting}
Internal meetings will occur every Monday 12:15, unless anything else is specified. At this time all the group members are open for meetings. During these meetings the plans for the week will be discussed, workload divided and what was done last week. Notes will be taken and documented for later review. The group meet daily on skype to keep everyone up to date on the project progress and what will be done.

\subsection{Sprint planning meeting}
Sprint planning meetings will be held in the start of every sprint. Which use cases to handle and complete will be discussed here. The tasks will also be discussed with the customer so the customer can help prioritise the use cases and tell us which tasks they want us to complete first.

\subsection{Sprint ending meeting}
Sprint ending meetings will be held Thursdays 19:15 in the end of the sprint week, unless anything else is specified. The group and the customer will be attending these meetings. An agenda will be sent to the customer, together with the weekly report and a link to the system, for the customer to test out. The demo will show the system and its new functionality. This lets the customer see the progress, and be able to come with inputs towards how their minds might differ from what has been produced, so the group can get on the right track if that is needed. This lets us make sure that we do not stray too far from the intended system. Since this is a meeting held with the customer the rules from the customer meetings will be held, so customer notes will be written during the meetings, compiled and sent back to the customer.

bank
school information system (boring)
time management system (aka calendar)
facebook console (unreal)
mail interface (gmail is too good, not useful)
photo gallery (limited)
music library (limited)
physician system (treatments, prescriptions, add person)
tax form (boring)

Criteria:
Interesting and simple enough for test subjects to understand. something they meet in everyday life
Complicated enough to demonstrate the problem.
Console has to be useful in the domain, ease the workflow
Object oriented design
Existence of power user, that will use the console

Customer ideas:
car models
finn.no
health sector
human resources (people, how they are related, symptoms, how much money and what they own - advanced domain graph). 
contact lists (peder)


write these things to the report


Future:
batch operations
undo the commands
save command for object attribute editing
what about object operations?
transaction support
