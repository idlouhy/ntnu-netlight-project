\section{Project name}
Project name is important project identificator. It should summarize main project goal or functionality. In real project, is often a trademark, or reflects the name of the company.

In this section, we will describe the process of choosing a name for the project. First of all, we made a list of words, that we can use in the project name. These words describe project funcionality or goal.

Words that can be used in project name: master, console, web, text, keyboard

We used the list of words and brainstorming session on a meeting for compiling a list of project name candidates:

Candidate project names: console 2.0, wonsole, wensole, websole, werminal, interCLI

After discussion we chose the name \emph{Wonsole}. Project name can be sometimes little confusing, so we added the subtitle: \emph{The new web console for power users.}

\section{Quality Assurance}
\subsection{Communication rules}
Communication with the customer is usually done by mail. The customer will contact the assigned customer contact if anything else is not specified. The assigned customer contact is responsible for relaying any information received from the customer to the other group members as soon as possible. The customer contact is also responsible for sending any information from the group to the customer. Any communication from the customer demanding a reply, will be replied to within 8 hours. If any communication is sent from the group to the customer demanding a reply, this reply should be received by the group within 24 hours.

The same rules apply to the communication with the advisor.

\subsection{Internal Routines}
Each group member is responsible for logging all their work hours in the timekeeping system within 22:00 the same day. All group members are also responsible for checking the Skype group conversation within 22:00 Monday to Thursday, to see if any important information is posted there. If important information has to be delivered after this time, it will be sent by mail. All group members are required to check Redmine each day to check if any new task are assigned to that person.

\subsection{Deliverables}
All deliverables, including source code, documents and meeting notes, will be approved by at least two of the group members before it is sent for approval by either the advisor or the customer. All major phase documents must be approved by all the group members before it is relayed to the advisor for approval.

\subsection{Meetings}

\subsubsection{Advisor meetings}
Advisor meetings will occur every Thursday 09:15, unless anything else is specified, so the advisor gets updated on the latest work and progress of the project. The day before the meeting the group sends the advisor an agenda for the meeting and a status report of what is done since the last meeting. This will be sent to the advisor within 14:00 the day before the meeting. If this deadline is not sustained, any needed documents will be printed out and brought to the meeting. This lets the advisor enter the meeting prepared, and improve the efficiency of the meeting. Under the meeting issues regarding the work done, plans for next week and project management will be discussed. If there is a sprint-end-week the demo for this sprint will also be shown. Advisor notes will be written during the meetings, compiled and sent back to the advisor within 12:00 the following day.

\subsubsection{Customer meetings}
Customer meetings will occurs on demand, but usually weekly, and Thursdays 19:15 if there is a sprint-end-week, unless anything else is specified. Meetings will be scheduled at least 48 hours before the meeting starts, and confirmation from the customer should be received at least 24 hours before. An agenda for the meeting and a weekly progress report will be sent to the customer to keep him in the loop of the progress, and get prepared before the meetings. This documentation, including other documents needed for the meeting, will be sent by mail within 24 hours before the meeting. Since the customer is busy during work hours, the meetings are kept after 18:00 on weekdays, and after 12:00 in weekends. They will be kept over Skype, since the customer is located in Oslo. The meetings will be used to get the customer in the loop, clarify uncertainties and redirecting, if the direction of the project taken is not what the customer had in mind. The customer should also be included in the sprint planning meetings to help with use case prioritization. Customer notes will be written during the meetings, compiled and sent back to the customer within 12:00 the following day.

\subsubsection{Internal meetings}
Internal meetings will occur every Monday 12:15, unless anything else is specified. At this time all the group members are open for meetings. During these meetings the plans for the week will be discussed, workload divided and what was done last week. Notes will be taken and documented for later review. The group meet daily on skype to keep everyone up to date on the project progress and what will be done.

\subsubsection{Sprint planning meetings}
Sprint planning meetings will be held in the start of every sprint. Which use cases to handle and complete will be discussed here. The tasks will also be discussed with the customer so the customer can help prioritise the use cases and tell us which tasks they want us to complete first. The selected user stories along with their Work Breakdown Structure will be sent to the customer for approval.

\subsubsection{Sprint demonstration meetings}
Sprint demonstration meetings will be held Thursdays 19:15 in the end of the each sprint, unless anything else is specified. The group and the customer will be attending these meetings. An agenda will be sent to the customer, together with the weekly report and a link to the system, for the customer to test out. The demo will show the system and its new functionality. This lets the customer see the progress, and be able to come with inputs towards how their minds might differ from what has been produced, so the group can get on the right track if that is needed. This lets us make sure that we do not stray too far from the intended system. Since this is a meeting held with the customer the rules from the customer meetings will be held, so customer notes will be written during the meetings, compiled and sent back to the customer.

\subsection{Version Control}
GitHub was selected as the tool for version control in this project. All the relevant work that is produced will be pushed to the repository using git, including all the documents for the report, source code, images, diagrams, and so on. The group members will commit and push their changes on a regular basis, ensuring that the repository is always up to date and available.

\subsection{Document Templates}
The group has created templates for the following documents:

\begin{itemize}
\item Weekly status report
\item Meeting agenda
\item Meeting notes
\end{itemize}

These templates are listed in the appendices.

\section{Lectures}
Lectures held by the course TDT4290 Customer Driven Project mainly aim to educate the students in the in the art of project management and the different tools used to handle this task in a better way. The lectures can give good insight into the workflow and how to avoid different issues, and should therefore be attended when the lecture involves tools used by the group or tools the group should consider using. After the lectures the group will reflect upon the presented material and if it is usable, or add value to our project, it will be integraded into the project.

\section{Issues}
\subsection{Issues regarding  the system}
The customer has a huge workforce at their disposal, and it can be introduced to us through the customer. If there would appear a problem regarding the system we can’t handle ourselves, we can contact the customer and they can forward the issue to other sections of the corporation for analysis and problem solving. The communication regarding issues of this kind will usually be done per email. 

\subsection{Issues regarding the workflow}
The advisor can help us with issues regarding project management and workflow issues. If the group were to be stuck at some point, the advisor can jank the group out of the ditch and set it back on track.

Criteria:
Interesting and simple enough for test subjects to understand. something they meet in everyday life
Complicated enough to demonstrate the problem.
Console has to be useful in the domain, ease the workflow
Object oriented design
Existence of power user, that will use the console

Customer ideas:
car models
finn.no
health sector
human resources (people, how they are related, symptoms, how much money and what they own - advanced domain graph). 
contact lists (peder)


write these things to the report


Future:
batch operations
undo the commands
save command for object attribute editing
what about object operations?
transaction support
