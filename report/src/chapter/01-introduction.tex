\section{NTNU}
NTNU (Norwegian University of Science and Technology) has the main responsibility for higher education in Norway. NTNU has a rich and diverse set of educational roads to pursue for instance faculty of architecture, faculty of humanities, faculty of information technology (which is the origin faculty of this course), and many more. There are about 22 000 students at NTNU, and of them about 1800 are exchange students.

\section{Netlight}
Netlight, our customer, is a Swedish IT- and consulting-firm. Their field of expertise is within IT-management, IT governance, IT-strategy, IT-organisation and IT-research. They deliver independent solutions based on the customers specs. With the broad field of knowledge they can handle whatever tasks presented by their customers. They reach this goal by focusing on competence, creativity and business sense.

\section{General information about project}
The project is the making of the course TDT4290 Customer Driven Project. This is a mandatory subject for all 4th year students at IDI and aims to give all its students experience in a customer guided IT-project and the feel of managing a project in a group. The customer assign the group a task which makes the project close to normal working life situation.

This is a proof of concept project. The underlying task is to research and develop a system where power users can benefit from a console.  The concept aims to ease the workload of a power user who is working with object editing, and to see how the efficiency of a console might prove to improve the work. The power user is usually a user who often works with the system over a longer time, and is in depth familiar with the system. We will research already existing systems of this kind, and look at the possibilities and advantages of such a system in a chosen domain.

We have chosen a library as our domain, and this will be used to explore and test the concept. The library domain is chosen since it possesses potential for the existence of power users and multiple input forms which could be made more efficient through a console. This domain also opens the opportunity to test our system on for instance employees on campus, which is important for the proving of the concept.

\subsection{Stakeholders}
The stakeholders in this project is any person or organization which has some interest or is affected by this system\'s development. They together constructs the different restrictions and goals of the project.

\subsubsection[]{The group}
The group role primarily is to meet all requirements presented by the customer and IDI, and are responsible for developing the system.

\subsubsection[]{The customer}
The customer describes and defines the requirements of the project. 

\subsubsection[]{The advisor}
The advisor advises and guides the group through the project.

\subsubsection[]{The librarians}
The librarians is the end user of this concept, and will help to verify the efficiency of it.



\section{Goals}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Create a working prototype of a system where a scripting console is embedded into a modern web interface. The console should provide access to viewing and modifying the underlying data objects of the system's domain via a DSL.
  \item Investigate the ramifications of the added functionality, in terms of usability and technical aspects.
  \item Provide extensive documentation and a successful presentation of the end product.
\end{enumerate}
